# CodeIgniter 4 Document Tracking System (DICT Timed Challenge)

This is a full-featured Document Tracking System built from scratch in **under 12 hours** as the final requirement for a DICT (Department of Information and Communications Technology) CodeIgniter 4 certification course.

🏆 **Awarded "Best Design"** among all participants for its clean UI and close adherence to the project requirements.

## The Challenge

The task was to develop a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with role-based user authorization. This project served as a practical exam to demonstrate a rapid grasp of MVC principles in a newly introduced framework.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Three distinct user roles (Admin, Staff, Encoder) with unique permissions, enforced via session-based authorization.
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Manage Users, Offices, and Documents.
- **Secure Authentication:** Passwords are securely stored using PHP's `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`.
- **Modern Frontend:** Built with Bootstrap 5 for a clean and responsive user interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** CodeIgniter 4
- **Language:** PHP 8
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Tools:** VS Code, XAMPP

## 🧠 Learning & Outcome
This high-pressure project was my first deep dive into CodeIgniter 4. A key part of my success in the 12-hour timeframe was leveraging **AI-assisted development tools (like GitHub Copilot/ChatGPT)** for boilerplate code generation and rapid debugging. This allowed me to focus on the core MVC logic and application structure.

Despite the tight deadline, I implemented all requirements, demonstrating an ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and use modern tools efficiently. The "Best Design" award validates my commitment to not just functional code, but also to a quality user experience.
